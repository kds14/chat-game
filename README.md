# Chat Game

A simple chat game made with rails backend. Note: Removing disconnected players isn't support in this version. However, it is supported in the Express version here: https://github.com/kds14/chat-game2

## Getting Started

Navigate to the chat-game folder in a terminal and type

bundle install

bin/rails server

Then open up two windows of any web browser (only tested in Chromium but should work with all modern web browsers) and connect to 127.0.01:3000 on both browsers. And then press join and click a room. Follow the instructions on screen to learn how to send messages and move.
